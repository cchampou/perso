## What I do

I currently work at [Komia](https://komia.io) as chief technology officer

## Where I live

I live in Lyon, France. It's a beautiful city located in the middle of the country,
known for its rich history, culture, and gastronomy. Lyon is the third-largest city in France, after Paris and Marseille, and is often referred to as the "Capital of Gastronomy".

## How I learned software development

I started pretty early, when I discovered on my parent's computer that simply instructing the computer to do something was possible.
At first I created simple websites with HTML and CSS, they looked terrible but the excitement of seeing something I created on the screen was amazing.
My father also introduced me to create electronic circuits with a breadboard and some components, I was fascinated by the idea. And both activities could converge just fine!

My studies were pretty chaotic, I started with a scientific baccalaureate, then I went to a preparatory class for engineering schools, which I did not finish.
I struggled to find my way, going from a two-year degree in electronics, electrotechnique and embedded systems, to a brief startup experience, but I finally found my way in software development.

Being a self-taught developer, I learned a lot by following online courses, and working on personal projects.
Then the 42 school in Paris was sealing the deal, and helped me reach professional level.
