Hi dear visitor of the Internet! I'm Clément! I am Software Engineer currently working as a Chief Technology Office at [Komia](https://komia.io) in Lyon, France. Lyon is my hometown, I was born and raised here. Working in IT was obvious for me, after years spent in front of the screen instead of going outside play football (or whatever kids are supposed to do).

My career started as a Frontend Software Engineer in a service company called LinkValue in 2018: surrounded by talented people and with a variety of missions, I had opportunities to grow and succeed.

Thoughout the many missions I was given, at Bedrock Streaming, Euronews, Hivebrite or Sparted, I gradually became a leading engineer dedicated to make startups thrive.

## How I learned software development

I started pretty early, when I discovered on my parent's computer that simply instructing the computer to do something was possible.
At first I created simple websites with HTML and CSS, they looked terrible but the excitement of seeing something I created on the screen was amazing.
My father also introduced me to create electronic circuits with a breadboard and some components, I was fascinated by the idea. And both activities could converge just fine!

My studies were pretty chaotic, I started with a scientific baccalaureate, then I went to a preparatory class for engineering schools, which I did not finish.
I struggled to find my way, going from a two-year degree in electronics, electrotechnique and embedded systems, to a brief startup experience, but I finally found my way in software development.

Being a self-taught developer, I learned a lot by following online courses, and working on personal projects.
Then the 42 school in Paris was sealing the deal, and helped me reach professional level.
