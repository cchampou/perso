European and Swiss alternatives to WeTransfer are a smart choice",["Date","2025-08-18T00:00:00.000Z"],"## Introduction\n\nWeTransfer has long been a go-to platform for sending large files quickly and easily. With millions of users worldwide, its simplicity and free tier have made it a staple for individuals and businesses alike. However, recent changes to its terms of service—particularly around data usage—and ongoing concerns about privacy, environmental impact, and digital sovereignty have led many to seek alternatives. European and Swiss platforms offer compelling benefits: stronger privacy protections, lower environmental impact, and support for European digital independence.\n\n## Privacy concerns with WeTransfer\n\nWeTransfer, while convenient, has faced scrutiny over its data handling practices, especially after a July 2025 update to its terms of service. The initial wording suggested that uploaded files could be used to \"improve performance of machine learning models,\" which included content moderation and other service improvements. This sparked significant backlash from users concerned about their data being used for AI training without explicit consent.\n\nFollowing widespread criticism, WeTransfer issued a public statement and revised its terms to explicitly clarify that it does not use user files to train AI models. The company removed the controversial language and reassured users that their content is only used for operating and improving the service, in accordance with its privacy and cookie policy.\n\nDespite these clarifications, other privacy concerns remain:\n\n- **Data storage and jurisdiction**: WeTransfer is based in the Netherlands, but it uses Amazon S3 servers, some of which are located in the United States. This means user data may still fall under U.S. laws like the CLOUD Act, potentially allowing government access to files stored on these servers.\n- **Lack of end-to-end encryption**: The free version of WeTransfer does not offer end-to-end encryption. Files are encrypted in transit but not at rest, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized access.\n- **GDPR compliance**: While WeTransfer claims compliance with GDPR, the use of non-EU servers and past policy ambiguities continue to raise questions about the robustness of its privacy protections.\n\n## Environmental impact\n\n- **Data centers and carbon footprint**: WeTransfer has pledged carbon neutrality, but its reliance on global data centers—some powered by non-renewable energy—raises questions about its true environmental impact.\n- **European alternatives**: Many European and Swiss platforms prioritize green energy and sustainable practices, hosting data in eco-friendly data centers within Europe.\n\n## Digital sovereignty and European independence\n\n- **Data localization**: Keeping data within European borders ensures it is governed by EU privacy laws, reducing exposure to foreign surveillance and legal requests.\n- **Swiss neutrality**: Swiss platforms, such as SwissTransfer, benefit from Switzerland’s strong privacy laws and political neutrality, offering an extra layer of security and trust.\n- **Supporting European tech**: Choosing European alternatives strengthens the local tech ecosystem, fostering innovation and reducing dependence on non-European infrastructure.\n\n## Top European and Swiss alternatives\n\n### SwissTransfer\n- **Key features**: No registration, 50GB free, end-to-end encryption, password protection, uses renewable energy\n- **Privacy/security**: High (Swiss privacy laws)\n- **Max free transfer**: 50GB\n- **Data location**: Switzerland\n\n### Smash\n- **Key features**: 2GB free, email required, French hosting\n- **Privacy/security**: GDPR-compliant\n- **Max free transfer**: 2GB\n- **Data location**: France\n\n### TransferNow\n- **Key features**: 5GB free, email required, French hosting, includes ads\n- **Privacy/security**: GDPR-compliant\n- **Max free transfer**: 5GB\n- **Data location**: France\n\n### WeSendit\n- **Key features**: 2GB free, no email required, Swiss hosting\n- **Privacy/security**: EFTA standards\n- **Max free transfer**: 2GB\n- **Data location**: Switzerland\n\n### FileMail\n- **Key features**: 5GB free, no email required, Norwegian hosting\n- **Privacy/security**: EEA standards\n- **Max free transfer**: 5GB\n- **Data location**: Norway\n\n### SendGB\n- **Key features**: 5GB free, password protection, email required, Estonian hosting\n- **Privacy/security**: GDPR-compliant\n- **Max free transfer**: 5GB\n- **Data location**: Estonia\n\n### TeraShare\n- **Key features**: Peer-to-peer, open-source, Belgian hosting\n- **Privacy/security**: High (direct transfer)\n- **Max free transfer**: Unlimited\n- **Data location**: Belgium\n\nThese platforms not only match WeTransfer’s ease of use but also offer superior privacy, sustainability, and compliance with European regulations.\n\n## How to transition\n\n1. **Evaluate your needs**: Determine your priority—privacy, file size limits, or ease of use.\n2. **Choose a platform**: Select a European or Swiss alternative that aligns with your requirements.\n3. **Migrate gradually**: Start with non-sensitive files to test the new service.\n4. **Educate your team**: Ensure everyone understands the benefits and how to use the new platform securely.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSwitching to a European or Swiss file-sharing platform is more than a technical change—it’s a commitment to privacy, sustainability, and digital sovereignty. By supporting these alternatives, you protect your data, reduce your environmental footprint, and contribute to a stronger, independent European digital economy.\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] [WeTransfer Privacy Policy (2025)](https://wetransfer.com/documents/WeTransfer_Privacy_Policy_20250715.pdf)\n[2] [ConsumerSearch: WeTransfer Security Measures](https://www.consumersearch.com/technology/wetransfer-s-free-version-security-measures-data-privacy-policies-explained)\n[3] [Wikipedia: WeTransfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeTransfer)\n[4] [European Alternatives to WeTransfer](https://european-alternatives.eu/alternative-to/wetransfer)\n[5] [SwissTransfer: Privacy-Focused File Sharing](https://www.tech2geek.net/6-best-secure-alternatives-to-wetransfer-in-2025-no-ads-fully-private/)\n[6] [WeTransfer Confirms Files Not Used to Train AI Models](https://startupnews.fyi/2025/08/05/wetransfer-confirms-files-not-used-to-train-ai-models-following-criticism-updates-terms-of-service/)\n[7] [WeTransfer issues flurry of promises that it's not using your data to train AI models](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/wetransfer-issues-flurry-of-promises-thats-not-using-your-data-to-train-ai-models-after-its-new-terms-of-service-aroused-suspicion)\n[8] [WeTransfer says files not used to train AI after backlash](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8mp79gyz1o)","src/content/blog/wetransfer.md","83cfd69e1e6d3e59",{"html":114,"metadata":115},"\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>WeTransfer has long been a go-to platform for sending large files quickly and easily.
