    <h2>What I do</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, I am working at <a target="_blank" href="https://hivebrite.io/">Hivebrite</a> as a senior React Native developer.
    </p>
    <h2>Where I live</h2>
    <p>
      I live in Lyon, France. It's a beautiful city located in the middle of the country, known for its rich history, culture, and gastronomy.
      Lyon is the third-largest city in France, after Paris and Marseille, and is often referred to as the "Capital of Gastronomy".

    <h2>How I learned software development</h2>
    <p>
      I started pretty early, when I discovered on my parent's computer that simply instruct the computer to do something was possible.
      At first I created simple websites with HTML and CSS, they looked terrible but the excitement of seeing something I created on the screen was amazing.
      My father also introduced me to create electronic circuits with a breadboard and some components, I was fascinated by the idea. And both activities could converge just fine!
    </p>
    <p>
      My studies were pretty chaotic, I started with a scientific baccalaureate, then I went to a preparatory class for engineering schools, which I did not finish.
      I struggled to find my way, going from a two-year degree in electronics, electrotechnique and embedded systems, to a brief startup experience, but I finally found my way in software development.
      Beeing a self-taught developer, I learned a lot by following online courses, and working on personal projects. Then the 42 school in Paris was sealing the deal, and helped me reach professional level.
