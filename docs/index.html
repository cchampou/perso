<p>Currently, I am working at <a href="https://hivebrite.io/">Hivebrite</a> as a senior React Native developer.</p>
<h2 id="where-i-live">Where I live</h2>
<p>I live in Lyon, France. It’s a beautiful city located in the middle of the country,
known for its rich history, culture, and gastronomy. Lyon is the third-largest city in France, after Paris and Marseille, and is often referred to as the “Capital of Gastronomy”.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-learned-software-development">How I learned software development</h2>
<p>I started pretty early, when I discovered on my parent’s computer that simply instructing the computer to do something was possible.
At first I created simple websites with HTML and CSS, they looked terrible but the excitement of seeing something I created on the screen was amazing.
My father also introduced me to create electronic circuits with a breadboard and some components, I was fascinated by the idea. And both activities could converge just fine!</p>
<p>My studies were pretty chaotic, I started with a scientific baccalaureate, then I went to a preparatory class for engineering schools, which I did not finish.
I struggled to find my way, going from a two-year degree in electronics, electrotechnique and embedded systems, to a brief startup experience, but I finally found my way in software development.
Being a self-taught developer, I learned a lot by following online courses, and working on personal projects.
Then the 42 school in Paris was sealing the deal, and helped me reach professional level.</p> </div> </body></html>
